# christians-pie-shop
ASP.NET Core Application

Christian's Pie Shop was built using the ASP.NET Core framework.  I followed along with the "Building Web Applications with ASP.NET
Core MVC" tutorial on Pluralsight by Gill Cleeren.  This project is modeled on Gill's "Bethany's Pie Shop."

In order to run the project, open it in Visual Studio, click on "Debug", and then click on "Start Without Debugging."
